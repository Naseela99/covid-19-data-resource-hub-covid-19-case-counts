# EDA Using Plotly

Listening to the word **data science**, the first thing that comes to the mind is machine learning and deep learning models. But it is much more than just training and deploying models.
Data science is all about **data**. It is exploring what our data can do for us and what actually our data is. Most of the time, we just jump to conclusions without actually exploring what our data is.

## What is EDA?

EDA refers to exploratory data analysis. It is a crucial part of data modelling, data analysis and data science. Everything falls apart if we do not understand our data well. EDA helps us to understand the data well. EDA involves representing the data in graphical and pictorial graphs. We can pick out the relations from the various columns in our data and decide what columns actually contribute to our problem statement. 

EDA is articularly in data that has numeric values. e.g in stock market prediction or prediction of house prices, we need to make a representation of what we already have in our data. This is done in form of bar graphs, line graphs and other forms. This is why EDA is crucial and important. It also helps us to recognize missing data. If we have a large gap in our dataset, it is probably because we have lost data or there is no data to look at this. This data can be entirely eliminated.


Now there are numerous ways for us to do EDA. Python has made the world of data scientists quite easy. So EDA with python is quite simple and hassle free. Python has many libraries that can be used for EDA. The most popular ones are matplotlib and seaborn. But in this project, we will be using plotly.

## Why plotly?

Plotly is a dashboard for building graphs and representations. The plotly library in python is quite powerful and can  make impressive plots. These plots are interactive, and this is exactly what data analysts want! The plots are almost self-descriptive. You can zoom in, zoom out, and view data by hovering over the data point.

Now that we know how powerful plotly is, let us talk about what we are doing here.

## Problem statement

We have seen the pandemic data all over the internet and yet the representaions in new and imporoved forms never stop. In this project, we have implemented the data in a different way based on their variants, date as well as the number of cases
